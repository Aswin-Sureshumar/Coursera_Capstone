    "Toronto is the biggest contributer to the finacial growth of canada and an essential economic hub of the world. It welcomes immigrants from all over the world and hence has lot of diversty. Toronto has a total area of 630.2 square kms having a populaton of 2,731,571 as of 2016. Having such a large area and population it is difficult for a business man to decide the ideal location for opening a new resturant and have success. This project will aid a person trying to open a Italian restaurant at the ideal location in Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Toronto has such a vast location and population, it is difficult to be successful in a business with huge competition. Hence we will target locations that contain less number of Italian restaurants as well as near to the city centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end this project, an ideal location for opening a Italian restuarant in Toronto will be suggested."

    "            K-means clustering algorithm is used to group the different neighbourhoods into clusters based on similarity. The best number of clusters was found to be 4 by using elbow method, which is a frequently used method to determine the ideal number of clusters."

    "Based on our initial analysis there are around 74 neighbourhoods in Toronto. Certain neighbourhoods contain more number of Italian Restaurants than other neighbourhoods as seen from Foursquare data. After clustering we can see that clusters 2 and 4 contain the most number of Italian restaurants even though they have low number of neighbourhoods. Clusters 1 and 3 seem to be ideal since they contain least number of Itailan restaurants while having lot of neighbourhoods. Neighbourhoods like Agincourt, Woodbine Heights, York Mills West present in cluster 1 are ideal places to start a new Italian restaurants while neighbourhoods like Brockton, Parkdale Village, Exhibition Place, University of Toronto and Harbord can also be taken into consideration."
