Toronto has a total area of 630.2 square kms having a populaton of 2,731,571 as of 2016. Having such a large area and population it is difficult for a business man to decide the ideal location for opening a new resturant and have success. This project will aid a person trying to open a Italian restaurant at the ideal location in Toronto.\n",

    "At the end this project, an ideal location for opening a Italian restuarant in Toronto will be suggested."
